# **Monitoring Tools and Alerts**

## Monitoring Tools in Use

### 1\. Amazon CloudWatch

* Primary monitoring service for infrastructure and application metrics  
* Configured for all critical services including EC2, RDS Aurora clusters, and application components  
* Key metrics being monitored:  
* EC2 instance CPU utilization  
* RDS database metrics (ReadLatency observed)  
* Instance health checks

### 2\. AWS CloudTrail

* Activity monitoring and audit logging via "AnalyzerCloudTrail"  
* Configuration:  
* Multi-region trail enabled (IsMultiRegionTrail: True)  
* Global service events included (IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: True)  
* Log file validation enabled (LogFileValidationEnabled: True)  
* S3 bucket for logs: 033030386697-cloudtrail-logs-access-analyzer-us-east-1

### 3\. Amazon GuardDuty

* Security monitoring and threat detection service  
* Detector ID: 18ca5478aa6e0491f9502ae3ce2512ec  
* Integrated with SNS for alerts

### 4\. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

* Alert notification system with the following topics:  
* EC2HighCPUAlerts  
* Givzey-Health-Alerts-dev-us-east-1  
* Givzey-Health-Alerts-prod-us-east-1  
* Givzey-Health-Alerts-staging-us-east-1  
* GivzeyMonitoring  
* GuardDuty-Alerts-dev-us-east-1  
* GuardDuty-Alerts-us-east-1  
* GuardDuty-Notifications

## Alert Thresholds and Configurations

### 1\. EC2 Instance Monitoring

* CPU Utilization Threshold: 80% (CPU-Utilization-i-0813ad2c727ec4750)  
* Evaluation Period: 2 consecutive periods  
* Period: 300 seconds (5 minutes)  
* Statistic: Average  
* Comparison Operator: GreaterThanThreshold

### 2\. Database Monitoring

* RDS Aurora clusters with monitoring metrics for:  
* ReadLatency  
* Multiple database instances across various availability zones are monitored

### 3\. Security Monitoring

* GuardDuty configured to detect:  
* Unusual API calls  
* Potentially unauthorized deployments  
* Suspicious network activity  
* Notifications sent to both email and SMS endpoints

## Incident Management Process

Based on the observed alerting infrastructure, here's an overview of your likely incident management process:

### 1\. Alert Detection and Notification

* CloudWatch detects metrics exceeding thresholds or GuardDuty identifies security concerns  
* SNS topics route notifications to appropriate channels:  
* Email notifications to IT team (it@givzey.com)  
* SMS alerts for critical issues (+14133742964)  
* Environment-specific topics (dev/staging/prod) ensure proper routing

### 2\. Triage and Escalation

* Multiple notification channels suggest a tiered response approach:  
* Level 1: Email notifications for standard alerts  
* Level 2: SMS notifications for urgent/critical issues  
* Environment-specific alerts (dev vs. prod) likely have different response SLAs

### 3\. Investigation Tools

* CloudTrail logs stored in S3 (033030386697-cloudtrail-logs-access-analyzer-us-east-1)  
* CloudWatch metrics and logs for performance analysis  
* GuardDuty findings for security incidents

### 4\. Response and Resolution

* Separate notification topics for different environments facilitate targeted responses  
* Monitoring across multiple availability zones enables failover decision-making
