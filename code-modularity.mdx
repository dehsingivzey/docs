# **Code Modularity and Maintainability**

This document outlines our primary deployable applications, their purposes, and the processes we use to ensure maintainable code and smooth deployments.

## **1\. Overview of Deployable Applications**

### **1.1 Version2**

* **Type:** Flask-based monolithic web application with a React front end

* **Deployment Environments:** Development and Production

* **Purpose:**

  * Primarily serves as an AI-driven platform for analyzing data, handling user interactions, and delivering AI-related features (e.g., conversation management)  
  * Exposes a REST API for internal usage as well as external integration points.

### **1.2 Gift Agreement Platform**

* **Type:** Flask-based monolithic web application with a React front end

* **Deployment Environments:** Development and Production

* **Purpose:**

  * Focused on donor and fundraising workflows, offering UI for organizations, donors, and fundraisers.

### **1.3 Data-Ingestion Tool (Web Scraper)**

* **Type:** Standalone service

* **Deployment Environments:** Local development via Localstack. Deployments and CI/CD via Pulumi

* **Purpose:**

  * Periodically scrapes or fetches data from external websites.

  * Processes the data, storing results into data stores (S3, DynamoDB).

  * Triggered AWS Lambda events.

## **2\. Infrastructure & Deployment Strategy**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)**

   * We have begun to use Pulumi to define and manage all AWS resources required by our applications.

2. **Environments**  
   * **Local Development Environments**: Used for daily coding, testing, and QA. May have partial feature flags enabled and mock services for external integrations.  
   * **Remote Development Environments**: testing, and QA. Staging before production releases

   * **Production Environments**: Stable releases along with feature flagging

## **3\. Code Modularity & Maintainability**

### **3.1 Monolithic Codebases with Internal Structure**

Although our applications are deployed as **monolithic** applications, we maintain a clear internal structure to improve maintainability:

* **Layered Architecture**:

  * **Controllers (Flask routes)**: Define HTTP endpoints, handle request/response, delegate logic to services.

  * **Service/Manager Layer**: Encapsulates business logic, validation, data aggregation, and external service calls.

  * **Data Access Layer**: Uses SQLAlchemy for database models and queries

* **Feature Flags**:

  * We use feature flags or environment-based configuration to selectively enable new functionality, reducing risk when rolling out major changes.

* **Documentation & Coding Standards**:

  * Python code follows PEP 8 and is automatically formatted with Black.

  * We maintain architectural diagrams and docstrings to help developers navigate the monolith.

### **3.2 Data-Ingestion Tool**

* **Purpose-Built Module**:

  * Designed as a separate codebase to scrape websites, parse data, and push results to Version2.

* **Triggering & Scheduling**:

  * Triggered via api call from Version2 web app

  * Deploys independently via Pulumi so that failures or changes in scraping logic don’t affect the main applications.

### **3.3 Testing & Code Coverage**

* **Unit and Integration Tests**:

  * Written using Python’s `unittest` framework, with coverage reporting powered by the `coverage` library.

* **Continuous Integration**:

  * Every merge request runs automated tests, coverage checks, linting, and security scans.

* **Maintainability Metrics**:

  * We track code coverage trends and code smells (via linting or static analysis), resolving issues that degrade maintainability.

## **4\. Scalability & Future Modularity**

1. **Microservice Transition**

   * While we currently deploy monoliths, each codebase is structured in a way that can be modularized or split into microservices when future scale demands it. 

   * Shared modules (e.g., authentication, data ingestion) could be extracted gradually.

2. **Infrastructure & Logging**

   * All deployable apps integrate with AWS CloudWatch for centralized logging and monitoring.

   * AWS IAM roles ensure secure resource access. If or when we break out services, these roles and logs will remain easy to manage.
