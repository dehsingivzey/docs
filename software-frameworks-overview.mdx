# **Technology Architecture & Frameworks Overview**

This document provides an overview of our software architecture with the main frameworks and libraries used across the data access layer, web (MVC) layer, security components, and other major server-side elements. We operate Python web applications built on **Flask** with a **React** frontend, integrated with various **AWS** services and third-party APIs.

---

## **1\. Data Access Layer**

Our primary interaction with relational data is through the **SQLAlchemy** ORM. Below are the key components involved in data access:

* **SQLAlchemy (Open Source)**

  * **Type:** ORM Framework

  * **Purpose:** Primary database access layer for PostgreSQL

  * **Notes:** Models are defined as Python classes; queries generated via SQLAlchemy methods.

* **SQLAlchemy-Continuum (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Database record versioning

  * **Notes:** Allows auditing and rollbacks of data changes over time.

* **Flask-SQLAlchemy (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Integration between Flask and SQLAlchemy

  * **Notes:** Simplifies ORM configuration within the Flask app.

* **Alembic \+ Flask-Migrate (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Database schema migrations

  * **Notes:** Alembic manages migration scripts; Flask-Migrate provides Flask commands for migration.

* **Psycopg2 (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** PostgreSQL driver

  * **Notes:** Underlying adapter for raw SQL access to PostgreSQL databases.

* **Boto3 (S3/DynamoDB)**

  * **Purpose:** AWS SDK for data access on S3 and DynamoDB

  * **Notes:** Used for storing files in S3 and for limited ephemeral data in DynamoDB.

* **Redis-py (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Redis client for Python

  * **Notes:** Used in conjunction with Celery for message queuing and caching.

### **Architecture Notes for Data Access**

1. **Models** are defined as Python classes (ORM).

2. **Migrations** are tracked via Alembic scripts

3. **AWS S3** is used for file storage. **DynamoDB** is used occasionally for specific job-tracking

4. **Redis** underpins Celery’s messaging for background tasks.

## **2\. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Model**

While we follow a loosely **MVC-style** structure, we actually use a **separation-of-concerns** approach where Flask handles the “Controller,” React handles the “View,” and SQLAlchemy handles the “Model.” We do minimal server-side HTML rendering, relying instead on a **React SPA** for the front end.

### **3.1 Server-Side Components**

* **Flask (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Web framework for routing and controllers

  * **Notes:** Defines RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and business logic.

* **Flask-WTF, Flask-Login, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS**

  * **Purpose:** Extensions for form handling, user sessions, JWT auth, CORS

  * **Notes:** Each extension is integrated at the Flask application level to handle cross-cutting concerns.

* **Jinja2 (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Template engine

  * **Notes:** Primarily used for minimal server-rendered pages or emails and some legacy non-customer facing ui, since most UI is React.

* **Marshmallow (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Serialization/Deserialization

  * **Notes:** Converts Python objects to JSON and vice versa for API responses.

### **3.2 Client-Side (View Layer)**

* **React (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Core UI library for the frontend

  * **Notes:** Implements the “View” in MVC, communicating with Flask APIs.

* **React Router, Redux \+ Redux Toolkit, Material UI, etc.**

  * **Purpose:** Routing, state management, and UI components

  * **Notes:** Provides a robust single-page application with well-organized user interactions.

### **3.3 How MVC Translates in Our App**

1. **Model**: SQLAlchemy (database models)

2. **View**: React application, plus minimal Jinja2 usage

3. **Controller**: Flask routes that handle requests and invoke domain logic in service classes

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns: front end is client-side rendered, while back end provides a stateless RESTful API.

## **3\. Security & Other Major Server-Side Frameworks**

### **4.1 Security & Authentication**

* **Flask-JWT-Extended (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** JWT token generation and validation

  * **Notes:** Centralizes our user auth flows.

* **Flask-Bcrypt (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Secure password hashing

  * **Notes:** Ensures stored passwords are salted and hashed.

* **AWS Secrets Manager (Commercial)**

  * **Purpose:** Secure storage of API keys and credentials

  * **Notes:** Rotates secrets and enforces least-privilege access via IAM roles.

* **IAM Roles (Commercial)**

  * **Purpose:** AWS authentication

  * **Notes:** Used to manage permissions for EC2, Lambda, and other AWS resources.

### **4.2 Background Processing & Messaging**

* **Celery (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Task queue for background processing

  * **Notes:** Manages async tasks like sending emails, data imports, or AI calls at scale.

* **Redis (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Message broker (for Celery) and caching

  * **Notes:** Communicates job status, handles ephemeral data.

* **Kombu (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Messaging library underlying Celery

  * **Notes:** Abstracts broker implementations.

### **4.3 API & External Services**

We integrate with multiple external services via official or custom SDKs:

* **OpenAI SDK (Commercial)** – AI service integration

* **AWS Bedrock SDK (Commercial)** – AWS-based AI model integration

* **SendGrid (Commercial)** – Email delivery and tracking

* **Twilio (Commercial)** – SMS message delivery

* **Requests (Open Source)** – For making HTTP requests to external APIs  
* **IgnitePost (Commercial)** \- Physical Mail Delivery  
* **Synthesia (Commercial)** \- Avatar Video Generation

### **4.4 Data Processing & Analytics**

* **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Data analysis, numerical computing, and visualizations

  * **Notes:** Primarily for internal dashboards and data transformations and ML.

## **4\. DevOps & Infrastructure**

* **Docker (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Containerization

  * **Notes:** Each service is packaged in containers for consistency across environments.

* **Gunicorn (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** WSGI server for Python applications

  * **Notes:** Production-grade server for Flask.

* **AWS Services (Commercial)**

  * **API Gateway:** Routes traffic to serverless or containerized backends

  * **Lambda:** Handles serverless functions for asynchronous tasks or webhooks

  * **CloudWatch:** Collects logs and metrics for monitoring

  * **Watchtower (Open Source plugin):** Sends Python logs to CloudWatch

  * **IAM, VPC, Auto Scaling, etc.:** Provide security, networking, and automated scaling

---

## **5\. Testing & Quality**

* **Unittest (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Standard Python testing framework

  * **Notes:** Used for unit tests and integration tests.  
* **Coverage (Open Source)**  
  * **Purpose:** Provides code coverage metrics to ensure our tests thoroughly exercise the codebase.  
* **Black (Open Source)**

  * **Purpose:** Automated code formatting

  * **Notes:** Ensures style consistency for Python code.

## **6\. Architecture Summary**

Overall, the system is designed around a **RESTful** architecture with a **React** front end and **Flask** back end:

* **Presentation Layer (View):**

  * React SPA

  * State management via Redux, styling with Material UI and bootstrap, and custom design systems.

* **Controller Layer (Flask):**

  * Defines REST endpoints.

  * Uses Marshmallow for serialization and JWT for authentication.

* **Service/Manager Layer:**

  * Encapsulates business logic (e.g., DonorManager, FundraiserManager, AgreementManager).

  * Coordinates transactions, background tasks (via Celery), and external API calls.

* **Data Access Layer (Model):**

  * SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL/Aurora as the primary database.

  * Migrations via Alembic/Flask-Migrate.

  * Version tracking through SQLAlchemy-Continuum.

* **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

  * **Security/Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended, AWS Secrets Manager, Python3-SAML.

  * **Logging/Monitoring**: Python logging, CloudWatch, Watchtower.

  * **Feature Flags**: For conditional feature rollouts.

  * **Background Processing**: Celery \+ Redis for asynchronous tasks.

This approach ensures loose coupling and scalability. The system can handle high-throughput workloads with Celery, scale horizontally with Docker containers, and integrate seamlessly with AWS for storage, monitoring, and serverless compute.
