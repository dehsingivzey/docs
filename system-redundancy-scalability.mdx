# System Redundancy and Scalability

## Database Redundancy

Multi-AZ Database Deployments:

* Several key Aurora PostgreSQL clusters are configured with Multi-AZ deployments:  
* ftp-cluster: MultiAZ \= True  
* givzey-production-rr-cluster: MultiAZ \= True  
* version2-dev: MultiAZ \= True  
* version2-prod-clstr: MultiAZ \= True  
* Each production database has reader replicas across multiple availability zones, for example:  
* Primary: version2-prod-clstr-instance-1 (us-east-1c)  
* Replica: version2-prod-clstr-instance-1-us-east-1d (us-east-1d)  
  Backup and Recovery Capabilities:  
* All database clusters have automated backups enabled with 30-day retention periods  
* Daily automated snapshots are taken during defined backup windows  
* Point-in-time recovery is possible with EarliestRestorableTime and LatestRestorableTime values  
* Dedicated backup-cluster for additional recovery options  
  Database Protection Features:  
* Deletion protection enabled on critical databases  
* Storage encryption enabled across all databases  
* CloudWatch logs exported for monitoring and troubleshooting

## Compute Redundancy

Multi-AZ EC2 Deployment:

* Production instances strategically distributed across multiple availability zones:  
* us-east-1a: Contains version2 production web and application servers  
* us-east-1b: Hosts bastion hosts and development servers  
* us-east-1d: Hosts givzey production application and web servers  
* Critical production applications have multiple identical instances across AZs  
  Bastion Host Redundancy:  
* Multiple bastion hosts for secure access:  
* givzey-bastion in us-east-1b  
* version2-bastion in us-east-1a  
* gvzbastionhost in us-east-1b  
* Auto Scaling Group configured for bastion hosts 

  Web Tier Redundancy:

* Multiple web servers for each application are running across AZs  
* CPU utilization alarms configured to alert on high usage (e.g., CPU-Utilization-i-0813ad2c727ec4750)

## Load Balancing and Failover

1. Application Load Balancer:  
* Givzey ALB is internet-facing and deployed across 4 availability zones:  
* us-east-1a  
* Us-east-1b  
* us-east-1c   
* us-east-1d   
* Health checks are configured with:  
* 30-second intervals  
* 5-second timeout  
* HTTP health check path  
* 5 healthy threshold / 2 unhealthy threshold  
1. Target Groups:  
* Multiple target groups for different applications:  
* Givzey (port 443, HTTPS)  
* givzey-dev-tg (port 5000, HTTP)  
* givzey-dev-tg-ip (port 5000, HTTP)  
* givzey-tg-bd64ba64 (port 5000, HTTP)  
1. DNS Failover:  
* Multiple Route53 hosted zones for domain management  
* Main application zones:  
* givzey.com (46 records)  
* version2ai.com (32 records)

## Scalability Features

1. Auto Scaling Configuration:  
* Auto Scaling Group configured for bastion hosts with:  
* Min size: 0  
* Max size: 1  
* Desired capacity: 0 (on-demand launching)  
* Launch configuration: bastion-launch-config  
* Multi-AZ capability: Configured for us-east-1b and us-east-1d  
* VPC Zone Identifier: subnet-0fcc23de0638c5937,subnet-05146df8ff2fc893b  
1. RDS Aurora Scalability:  
* Reader endpoints for read scaling  
* Performance monitoring enabled for production clusters:  
* Performance insights enabled with 7-day retention  
* Enhanced monitoring with 60-second intervals  
1. Instance Types for Vertical Scaling:  
* Various instance types used for different workloads:  
* Web servers: t2.micro, t2.small, t3.small  
* Application servers: t2.medium, t3.medium, t3.large, t2.xlarge  
* Development servers: t2.2xlarge, t3.large
